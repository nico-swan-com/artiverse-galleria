## Original Report

### ðŸ”´ Critical Issues

#### 1. Inefficient Database Connection Management

- **Location:** `src/lib/database/data-source.ts`, `src/lib/authentication/next-auth.ts`, and all repository files.
- **Issue:** The database connection is re-initialized (or checked via `await`) before every single database query. This is caused by the `await initializeDatabase()` call within the `getRepository` function, which is used by all repositories. This adds significant, unnecessary latency to every database operation and will cause severe performance and scalability problems under load.
- **Recommendation:**
  - **Decouple Initialization from Requests:** The database connection should be initialized only once when the application server starts.
  - **Use a Singleton Promise:** Create a global singleton promise for the database connection that is awaited by API routes or services that need it. This ensures the initialization code runs only once.
  - **Refactor `getRepository`:** Remove the `await initializeDatabase()` call from `getRepository`. This function should synchronously return a repository from the already-initialized data source.

#### 2. Systemic Leakage of Server-Side Code to the Client

- **Location:** `src/lib/users/`, `src/lib/products/`, `src/components/`, `src/contexts/`
- **Issue:** The project's use of barrel files (`index.ts`) that export everything from a directory (`export * from ...`) causes server-only libraries like TypeORM and `bcryptjs` to be included in the client-side JavaScript bundle. This happens because a client component (e.g., `UsersPage.tsx`) imports a client-safe type (e.g., `User` from a Zod schema), but the module it imports from also exports the server-side TypeORM entity. This dramatically increases bundle size and is a major architectural flaw.
- **Recommendation:**
  - **Create a Shared Types Directory:** Create a dedicated, client-safe directory like `src/types/` or `src/shared/`.
  - **Move DTOs:** Move all Zod schemas and their inferred types (like `User` and `Product`) into this new directory.
  - **Update Imports:** All client-side components (`*.tsx`, contexts, hooks) must only import types from this new shared directory. They should never import anything from `src/lib/`.
  - **Clean Up Barrel Files:** The barrel files in `src/lib/` should be reviewed to ensure they only export server-side code.

#### 3. Critical Bug in User Session Management

- **Location:** `src/lib/authentication/next-auth.ts`
- **Issue:** The `jwt` callback does not add the user's `id` or `role` to the JWT token upon sign-in. Consequently, the `session` callback cannot add this information to the session object. This means that any authenticated API request or server-side render that relies on `session.user.id` will fail because the ID is missing.
- **Recommendation:**
  - In the `authorize` function, ensure the returned user object includes `id` and `role`.
  - In the `jwt` callback, persist these values to the token object.
  - In the `session` callback, a new property needs to be added to the user object, as the default user object does not contain `id`.

#### 4. Highly Inefficient Data Fetching for "Related Artworks"

- **Location:** `src/app/(public)/artworks/[id]/page.tsx`
- **Issue:** To display related items, the page fetches all products from the database and then filters them in JavaScript. This is extremely unscalable and will cause the page to slow down dramatically as the number of products increases.
- **Recommendation:**
  - Create a new method in `ProductsRepository` (e.g., `findRelated(artworkId, category, style, artistId)`) that performs the filtering and limiting at the database level using a proper SQL query. This will be orders of magnitude more efficient.

### ðŸŸ  High-Severity Issues

#### 1. Insecure Error Handling in API Routes

- **Location:** `src/app/api/media/list/route.ts` (and likely others)
- **Issue:** The API route's `catch` block leaks raw internal error messages to the client (`{ error: (error as Error).message }`). This can expose sensitive information about the database or application internals.
- **Recommendation:**
  - Implement a centralized error handling mechanism.
  - For unexpected errors, log the full error on the server using a proper logging service and return a generic "Internal Server Error" message to the client.
  - Create custom error classes for expected failures (e.g., `NotFoundError`) and map them to appropriate HTTP status codes (e.g., 404).

#### 2. Poor Error Handling in Authentication

- **Location:** `src/lib/authentication/next-auth.ts`
- **Issue:** The `authorize` function's `catch` block swallows all errors (e.g., database connection failure) and returns `null`, making it indistinguishable from a simple "user not found" case. This makes debugging critical server-side issues very difficult.
- **Recommendation:**
  - For credential validation failures (user not found, password mismatch), throw a specific `CredentialsSignin` error from NextAuth.
  - For unexpected server errors, log the error details and throw a generic error to prevent login while indicating a server problem.

### ðŸŸ¡ Medium-Severity Issues

#### 1. Flawed Server Action Error Handling

- **Location:** `src/components/authentication/submit-login.action.ts`
- **Issue:** The login server action does not correctly handle Zod validation errors. It catches the error but doesn't extract the specific field errors, preventing the UI from showing targeted feedback (e.g., "Email is invalid"). It also has a type mismatch when handling the error from `signIn`.
- **Recommendation:**
  - In the `catch` block, check if the error is a `ZodError`. If so, use `error.flatten().fieldErrors` to populate the form state with specific error messages for each field.
  - Correctly map the string error from `signIn` to a `LoginFieldErrors` object.

#### 2. Redundant State Management in Cart Context

- **Location:** `src/contexts/cart.context.tsx`
- **Issue:** The context uses a `useState` and `useEffect` to manage `itemCount`, which is redundant. This value can be derived directly from the `cart` array, simplifying the code and removing an effect.
- **Recommendation:**
  - Remove the `itemCount` state variable and the corresponding `useEffect`.
  - Calculate the item count directly from the `cart` state where needed: `const itemCount = cart.reduce((total, item) => total + item.quantity, 0);`.

#### 3. Outdated Next.js Configuration

- **Location:** `next.config.ts`
- **Issue:** The configuration file uses an unrecognized experimental flag, `nodeMiddleware: true`, which causes a warning during the build process.
- **Recommendation:**
  - Remove the `nodeMiddleware: true` line from the `experimental` block in the configuration file.

This concludes my review. Please let me know if you have any questions.

## Implementation Plan with Prompts

This section outlines the implementation plan with specific prompts that can be used to guide an AI assistant in completing each task.

### Phase 1: Critical Architecture and Bug Fixes

1.  **Fix Database Connection Management**
    - **Prompt:** "Refactor the database connection management to use a singleton promise pattern. The goal is to initialize the database only once when the application server starts. You will need to modify `src/lib/database/data-source.ts` to export a singleton promise for the database connection, and update the `getRepository` function to use this promise. Also, remove any redundant `await initializeDatabase()` calls from repository files and `src/lib/authentication/next-auth.ts`."

2.  **Resolve Server-Side Code Leakage**
    - **Prompt:** "Resolve the server-side code leakage issue by creating a dedicated, client-safe directory at `src/types/`. Move all Zod schemas and their inferred types from `src/lib/users/` and `src/lib/products/` into this new directory. Then, update all client-side components (files in `src/components/`, `src/contexts/`, and `src/hooks/`) to import these types only from `src/types/`. Finally, review and clean up the barrel files (`index.ts`) in `src/lib/` to ensure they do not export any server-side code to the client."

3.  **Correct Session Management**
    - **Prompt:** "Correct the critical bug in user session management. In `src/lib/authentication/next-auth.ts`, modify the `authorize` function to ensure the returned user object includes `id` and `role`. Then, update the `jwt` callback to persist these values to the token. Finally, update the `session` callback to add the user's `id` and `role` to the session object."

### Phase 2: API and Data Fetching Optimization

1.  **Optimize "Related Artworks" Fetching**
    - **Prompt:** "Optimize the data fetching for related artworks. Create a new method in `src/lib/products/products.repository.ts` called `findRelated`. This method should accept parameters such as `artworkId`, `category`, `style`, and `artistId`, and perform the filtering and limiting at the database level using a proper SQL query. Then, update the `src/app/(public)/artworks/[id]/page.tsx` component to use this new repository method instead of fetching all products and filtering them in JavaScript."

2.  **Secure API Error Handling**
    - **Prompt:** "Implement a centralized error handling mechanism for API routes. Start by creating a custom error handler. Then, review the API route at `src/app/api/media/list/route.ts` and any other API routes, and modify their `catch` blocks to use the new error handler. The goal is to log the full error on the server and return a generic 'Internal Server Error' message to the client for unexpected errors. Also, create custom error classes for expected failures (e.g., `NotFoundError`) and map them to appropriate HTTP status codes."

3.  **Improve Authentication Error Handling**
    - **Prompt:** "Improve the error handling in the authentication process. In `src/lib/authentication/next-auth.ts`, modify the `authorize` function's `catch` block. For credential validation failures (e.g., user not found, password mismatch), throw a specific `CredentialsSignin` error from NextAuth. For unexpected server errors, log the error details and throw a generic error to prevent login while still indicating a server problem."

### Phase 3: Code Quality and Minor Bug Fixes

1.  **Refactor Login Server Action**
    - **Prompt:** "Refactor the login server action for better error handling. In `src/components/authentication/submit-login.action.ts`, modify the `catch` block to check if the error is a `ZodError`. If it is, use `error.flatten().fieldErrors` to populate the form state with specific error messages for each field. Also, correctly map the string error from `signIn` to a `LoginFieldErrors` object."

2.  **Simplify Cart Context**
    - **Prompt:** "Simplify the state management in the cart context. In `src/contexts/cart.context.tsx`, remove the `itemCount` state variable and the corresponding `useEffect`. Instead, calculate the item count directly from the `cart` state where needed using `const itemCount = cart.reduce((total, item) => total + item.quantity, 0);`."

3.  **Update Next.js Config**
    - **Prompt:** "Update the Next.js configuration. In `next.config.ts`, remove the `nodeMiddleware: true` line from the `experimental` block to resolve the build warning."
